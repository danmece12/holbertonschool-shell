# Basics Directory

This folder contains the first shell-script exercises:

- `0-current_working_directory` — prints the absolute path of the current working directory.
- `1-listit` — displays the contents of the current directory.
- `2-bring_me_home` — changes the working directory to the user’s home (must be run with `source`).
- `3-listfiles` — displays current directory contents in long format (uses `ls -l`).
- `4-listmorefiles` — displays all files—including hidden ones—in long format (uses `ls -la`).
- `5-listfilesdigitonly` — displays all files (including hidden) in long format with numeric user and group IDs (uses `ls -lan`).
